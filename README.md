# Subtasked 🧠⏱️  
*A focused productivity app for deep, deliberate work*

## ✨ What is Subtasked?

**Subtasked** is a productivity-focused web app that helps you break large goals into manageable, focused tasks — inspired by the principles in *Deep Work* and *How to Become a Straight-A Student* by Cal Newport.

This isn’t just another to-do list. It’s about creating a system that actually helps you **work with intention** — not just stay busy.

## 🌟 Why I Built This

I wanted a tool to help me beat procrastination and improve how I plan, break down, and track tasks.

Most to-do list apps are either too basic or too bloated. **Subtasked** is designed to solve problems I actually face:

- Procrastination and overwhelm with big tasks  
- Underestimating or overestimating how long things take  
- Not planning work in a way that supports deep focus  
- Not reviewing how my time was actually spent

The core inspiration comes from:

- 🧠 *Deep Work* — creating space for distraction-free, high-impact work  
- 📘 *How to Become a Straight-A Student* — practical systems for focused daily planning

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend (Coming Soon)**  
- React + Vite  
- Tailwind CSS (latest)  
- Framer Motion (for smooth animations)  
- REST API integration with backend  

**Backend**  
- FastAPI (Python)  
- SQLite (for now — lightweight and simple)  
- SQLAlchemy (ORM for models)  
- Pydantic (data validation)

## 🔁 Development Approach

I’m building this app **logic-first** — backend first, UI second:

1. ✅ Define the backend logic, structure, and database (done)  
2. 🎨 Design the frontend based on actual logic  
3. 💻 Build frontend with clean transitions and animation  
4. ✨ Add future polish like stats, auth, and planning tools  

---

## ✅ Features So Far

- Create and manage **goals**
- Create **tasks**, estimate time, track actual time spent
- Break tasks into **subtasks**
- Mark subtasks as either **deep** or **shallow** work
- Prevent task completion unless all subtasks are done
- Add **daily planner entries**
- Add **daily review logs**

---

## 🔜 Planned Features

- Task **priority tagging**
- Weekly **focus trends**
- Optional: Link tasks to **goals**
- User **authentication**
- Mobile-responsive UI  
- Visualizations / stats for deep vs shallow work

## 🚧 Project Status

Subtasked is still under development. You don’t need to download or run anything yet — I’m finalizing logic, structure, and design.

Once it’s stable, I’ll include setup instructions and possibly host a live demo.

## 📚 Books That Shaped This

- *Deep Work* — Cal Newport: for its emphasis on high-quality, focused work sessions  
- *How to Become a Straight-A Student* — Cal Newport: for its focus on task chunking, planning ahead, and finishing work during scheduled blocks

The main goal: help you actually do the hard thinking and deep work, one subtask at a time.
