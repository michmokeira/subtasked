# Subtasked 🧠⏱️  
*A focused productivity app for deep, deliberate work*

## ✨ What is Subtasked?

Subtasked is deeply inspired by two books by **Cal Newport**:

- **🧠 _Deep Work_**: Focus is a skill. Shallow work is easy and endless. This book emphasizes scheduling long, uninterrupted time blocks to do truly important work — without distractions.
- **📘 _How to Become a Straight-A Student_**: A practical guide to using systems for studying efficiently, including breaking large assignments into small tasks, planning your day the night before, and tracking how long tasks actually take.

Together, these books taught me that:

- People procrastinate because they don’t know *where to start*.
- Estimating vs. actual time is key for getting better at planning.
- Shallow work (emails, errands, small tasks) should be separated from deep work (thinking, designing, writing, etc.)
- Daily reviews help you improve, instead of just rushing to the next thing.

So I built **Subtasked** — a tool I personally needed — to apply those ideas in real life.

## 🔁 Development Approach

I’m building this app **logic-first** — backend first, UI second:

1. ✅ Define the backend logic, structure, and database (done)  
2. 🎨 Design the frontend based on actual logic  
3. 💻 Build frontend with clean transitions and animation  
4. ✨ Add future polish like stats, auth, and planning tools

## ✅ Features So Far

- Create and manage **goals**(optional parents to tasks)
- Create **tasks**, estimate time, track actual time spent
- Break tasks into **subtasks**
- Mark subtasks as either **deep** or **shallow** work
- Prevent task completion unless all subtasks are done
- Add **daily planner entries**
- Add **daily review logs**

Subtasked is still under development. You don’t need to download or run anything yet — I’m finalizing logic, structure, and design.

Once it’s stable, I’ll include setup instructions.
